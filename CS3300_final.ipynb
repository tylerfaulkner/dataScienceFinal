    "# CS3300 - Final Project\n",
    "### By: Neel Desai and Tyler Faulkner\n",
    "### Due: February 21, 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the questions we are aiming to answer with this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do any variables correalate to if the student gets placed or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "How well does a predictive classification model perform using correlated variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does that model compare to models using other selections of variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "If variables in the data set show correlation to the student's placement after college, then a relatively accurate predictive model can be trained to predict a student's placement post-college.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we will be analyzing is the College Recruitment data which can be found at the link below on Kaggle:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set was created to analyze what academic and employability factors influence whether a student gets placed into a career. The dataset was created from data from the information about MBA students during the January 2022 term from CMS Business School located in India. The original data can be found below:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/DG1606/CMS-R-2020\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes 15 columns in total. The serial number column will not be used since it only serves as a unique identifier for each entry. The salary column will also not be used since it only applies to students who got placed into a career and does not apply to actually placing in a career in itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 categorical variables in the data and 5 numerical variables we will be using in total. The placed variable will be our target variable to see if we can predict.\n",
